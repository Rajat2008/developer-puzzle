What is done well?
1.Path aliases have been used in imports.
2.TSLint has been used for static code analysis.
3.Lazy Loading of Modules has been used.
4.storeDevToolModule has been used to visualize and perform actions on the Redux state tree of the application.


What would you change?
I would -
1. disable 'Go' button untill the form is valid. - Fixed
2. display error messages, in case of backend failure.
3. display spinner or loader to improve user experience.
4. move constants to a separate file for better code structure. - Fixed in chart.component.ts and stocks.component.ts
5. comment the code properly for better understanding. - Fixed 
6. move the hardcoded strings in template to Typescript code. - Fixed in stocks.component.ts


Are there any code smells or problematic implementations?
1.Public and private access modifiers are not used in member methods/variables of components. (line 15 - stocks.component.ts) - Fixed
2.Unused variables priod, symbol in stocks.component.ts - Fixed 
3.Unused variables present - changedDetectionStrategy, ChangeDetectorRef - Fixed in chart.component.ts. 
4.'any' type has been used in variable declaration. - Fixed in chart.component.ts (line 18)
5.Incorrect variable ‘data’ used for *ngIf inside chart.component.html. It should be ‘chartData’. - Fixed
6.operators safe navigation operator has not been used in chart.component.html. - Fixed
7.Return type of methods have not been specified. - fixed in stocks.component.ts (fetchQuote method)
8.Subscriptions have not been unsubscribed in chart.component.html - Fixed - unsubscription done using takeUntil 
9.Use interfaces for type safety wherever possible - Fixed in chart.component.ts and stocks.component.ts
